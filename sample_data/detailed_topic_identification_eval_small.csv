"Additional, targeted fiscal support is warranted in 2022-2023. The 2022 Budget allocated RM23 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) out of the COVID Fund for COVID-related spending, with an increasing share spent on upskilling programs, social assistance support to vulnerable groups, and SME financing. Considering the still-sizable projected economic slack, medium-term pandemic scarring effects, generally favorable debt dynamics, and staff’s assessment that debt is sustainable (Appendix II), staff advice is to provide modest additional fiscal support by about 2 percentage points cumulatively in 2022 and 2023 above the 2022 budget plans, moving the fiscal impulse in 2022 from negative to moderately positive territory, and delaying the start of consolidation by one year to 2023.8 The additional stimulus would close the output gap faster than in the baseline, thus helping limit the pandemic’s scarring effects. Targeted additional spending should center on protecting the vulnerable (notably low-income highly-indebted households), supporting viable SMEs in hard-hit sectors, and minimizing the impact of scarring on inequality, and increasing productive capacity—through public investments in green and climate-resilient projects, improved training and education, strengthened health policies, and digital transformation. However, the higher public debt with pre-COVID-19 fiscal vulnerabilities, warrants a cautious approach towards continued fiscal support, as a protracted pandemic could entail future spending pressures. In that respect, federal government debt remains below the effective debt limit (of 67 percent of GDP) implied by the twice- raised 65 percent of GDP limit on domestic debt under both baseline and staff recommended fiscal paths. Furthermore, staff recommendation involves a larger consolidation (by about 3 percentage points) in the medium term compared to the passive baseline, that would put debt on a firm downward trend and help rebuild fiscal buffers necessary to respond to future shocks.",Fiscal Management,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,
"The authorities agreed that additional fiscal support focused on supply-side measures is warranted in 2022. They also backed the idea of a medium-term expenditure-based consolidation plan, to be implemented only once the recovery is on firm ground. They concurred that the near-term priority for fiscal policy is to support the recovery and minimize scarring by boosting workers skills and investment, and shared the view that the improvement in the fiscal deficit envisaged in the 2022 budget would not constitute a tightening of the fiscal stance but rather an appropriate scaling down of emergency support programs. While the authorities agreed that some of the measures in response to rising energy prices are widely distributed, they preferred a broader and swift approach to provide timely support to all the households significantly impacted by the surge in energy prices. They stressed that these measures would be temporary. The authorities underscored that a priority beyond 2022 is to redress France’s public finances and rebuild fiscal buffers while making space for critical investment to support the green and digital transformation, and to facilitate reallocation of resources. They highlighted that the “France 2030” plan goes in this direction and agreed with staff that ensuring good governance of the program, with strong private-sector involvement, would be key. They aim at stabilizing public debt and get it on a declining path by 2026, as recommended by staff, by boosting potential growth factors and containing government expenditure, prioritizing growth-friendly expenditure. The authorities remain convinced that a reform of the pension system should play a key role. They also concurred with other priority areas for savings outlined by staff but consider that structural spending reforms will need to be implemented after a new government takes office. The authorities reiterated their commitment toward safeguarding public funds.",Fiscal Management,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,
"Box 1. Jordan: Past Fund Staff Advice and Implementation Macroeconomic policies were implemented with delays but broadly in line with past staff advice. Despite efforts, however, fiscal consolidation fell short of expectations, reflecting sizable revenue shortfalls— due to widespread weaknesses in tax administration, low-quality measures, delays in implementation, and some tax policy reversals—and public financial management deficiencies.
Improving the tax framework. Macro-critical measures, such as the reduction of sales-tax exemptions and amendments to the income tax law, have strengthened the tax policy framework. However, persistent weaknesses in tax administration, inability to tackle tax evasion and smuggling, and some tax policy reversals contributed to sizable revenue slippages over 2018-19. To reduce deviations from program targets, the authorities have often relied on low-quality measures, including cuts to capital spending and postponing the clearance of domestic arrears. Combined with delayed structural reforms, this has undermined growth.
Containing fiscal losses from utilities. The automatic electricity tariff adjustment mechanism has curbed NEPCO’s losses since end-2017, while protecting vulnerable people, but it has been unevenly implemented. Moreover, the recently-approved Roadmap Towards Financial Sustainability of the Power Sector aims to support NEPCO’s financial sustainability and to reform Jordan’s cross-subsidized tariff structure that penalizes some businesses. Implementation of the water-sector action plan has somewhat contained losses in this sector; but delays in a number of action-plan measures, together with higher electricity costs, suggest the need for refinements to the strategy.
Ensuring adequate reserve buffers to preserve the exchange-rate peg at a time of high regional and domestic uncertainty. Notwithstanding the persistently challenging regional environment, the CBJ has been able to maintain an appropriate monetary policy stance, geared toward ensuring adequate reserve coverage. The banking sector has remained well capitalized, provisioned, and profitable, despite a prolonged slowdown in economic activity.
Progress on structural reforms.
Fostering inclusive growth and job creation by generating a business environment more conducive to investment. Albeit with delays, the business environment has been strengthened through passage of the inspection, insolvency and secured lending laws. These laws, together with a fully operational credit bureau, will help facilitate access to finance for SMEs.
Strengthening the social safety net and addressing constraints to female labor market participation. A three-year program, developed in collaboration with the World Bank, has led to the expansion of the National Aid Fund’s cash-transfer program and improved its targeting. Several recent regulations have promoted flexible work arrangements and access to childcare services to boost female participation in the labor force.
Reducing payroll taxes. High social security contributions are regarded as a key impediment to formal employment. Recent amendments to the Social Security Law have paved the way for implementing a temporary reduction in contribution rates for targeted groups (long-timed recommended by staff).",Fiscal Management,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,
"The authorities consider that geopolitical tensions, high inflation and a worsening of the economic outlook are the main risks to Italy’s financial stability. Nonetheless, the situation in the banking system has improved significantly over the past decade, including as a result of tightening national supervision and substantial reductions in NPLs. Funding and credit risks, including from CRE exposures, are present and are being scrutinized. Banks’ plans for repaying TLTROs are being closely monitored and, in general, banks intend to cover any remaining gap beyond their excess reserves through a combination of bond issuance, central bank financing, term deposits and trimming back their balance sheets. While banks have significant sovereign exposure, the impact on capital of changes in yields is limited as a large part of these holdings is at amortized cost. Moreover, these holdings provide high-quality collateral for refinancing. Recent harmonization of the framework for covered bonds with EU standards provides banks an additional source of long-term funding. CRE is less of a concern in Italy reflecting the moderate average LTV rate at current prices and limited possibilities for early redemptions from REIFs. As regards smaller banks, in recent years, the national authorities have improved their supervisory tools also thanks to cooperation with the SSM, including by using stress-test results to guide capital requirements. Assessments of banks’ business models have identified those banks in need of improvement; the assessments have been followed up by targeted supervisory actions entailing, where necessary, the orderly exit from the market of a few banks. Expanding the tools to manage problem banks promptly would limit contagion risk. Provided shareholders and managers forfeit their stakes, a role for nonstandard vehicles financed by other banks and on market terms could therefore be considered. To protect continuity of service delivery, the Bank of Italy is also monitoring the soundness of banks’ external loan servicers and IT providers. Given the low NPL rate, there is no need at present for special instruments to support banks in disposing of their NPLs, but the tools have been readied if needed.",Financial Stability,Financial Stability,Financial Stability,
"The banking sector is in good financial health, but risks remain. Despite ample capital and liquidity buffers prior to the pandemic, the COVID crisis and a slow recovery could pose challenges. Since non-performing loans (NPL) tend to respond with a lag to an underlying weakening of the economy, elevated credit risk may materialize with a delay. Asset quality may weaken with the lapse of the temporary tax deferrals to SMEs while the deferrals of loan payments allowed during the pandemic could delay realization of NPLs. Since March 2020, NPLs increased from 8.3 to 10.5 percent, and banks’ profitability and capital ratios have declined somewhat (Table 10). The most affected were loans in trade, services, construction, transport, agriculture, and mortgages. The stress tests conducted by the NBKR indicate that the banking sector is resilient to severe shocks, including further deterioration of credit quality, thanks to strong capital buffers with the capital adequacy ratio at nearly 25 percent at end-2020. The NBKR is committed to continued supervisory vigilance and comprehensive stress-testing to monitor systemic vulnerabilities. The mission underscored and the authorities agreed that maintaining sound accounting, reporting, and provisioning standards is critical to properly appraise risks, while allowing banks sufficient time to restore capital, if impaired. Preparing a comprehensive NPL resolution strategy would also be essential.",Financial Stability,Financial Stability,Financial Stability,
"The macroprudential stance is broadly appropriate and minimum regulatory and supervisory standards should be maintained, given the uncertain financial outlook. The temporary reduction in capital and liquidity requirements and allowing for regulatory flexibility targeted at providing relief to solvent borrowers are appropriate, especially if stress returns in financial markets. Any regulatory flexibility should be temporary, and time bound; a permanent and significant relaxation of micro-prudential requirements or rules that assess banks’ asset quality, which may compromise the long-term stability of the financial system should be avoided. Close monitoring of bank capital is warranted going forward, especially if the shock persists. In this context, the authorities should also continue to enhance financial integrity in the post-crisis environment, by maintaining efforts to upgrade the AML/CFT supervision of small banks rated as high-risk (see IMF Country Report No. 19/241 and Annex II). Maintaining limits on other macroprudential measures (borrower-based measures and the large exposure limit) is adequate given the need to mitigate risks from corporate and household indebtedness. Guidance by the supervisory authorities to limit dividend payouts while certain support measures are in place is prudent and should continue until the shock is weathered. Once the recovery takes hold, the authorities could put in place a sectoral systemic risk buffer calibrated to corporate exposures, to be activated appropriately should systemic risks from corporate leverage intensify, in line with the 2019 FSAP recommendation. The development of concentration thresholds for direct exposures within conglomerates and common exposures among entities should also be considered to mitigate amplification risks from interconnectedness.",Financial Stability,Financial Stability,Financial Stability,
"Durably reducing inflation to its target and anchoring expectations will require a tight policy stance and effective communication. Further hikes in the policy rate may be needed depending on the evolution of factors, including actual inflation, inflation expectations, and demand conditions. Based on currently available information, a tight monetary policy stance—with the policy rate above the neutral rate—would need to be maintained beyond 2023 to durably restrain internal demand and anchor inflation expectations. A tightening bias is also warranted as a risk-based approach against upside risks to inflation and to safeguard the central bank’s credibility, since indexation to past inflation (e.g. rents) creates persistence in inflation dynamics and inflationary shocks, which, even if supply-driven, can have second-round effects on core inflation and inflation expectations (see SIP). A tighter fiscal policy stance can further support disinflation and avoid overburdening monetary policy (see SIP). Effective communication, emphasizing that monetary policy will remain tight and data-dependent, remains key to reduce uncertainties, anchor expectations, and maintain central bank credibility.",Monetary Policy Adjustment,Monetary Policy,Monetary Policy,
"The authorities noted that the current monetary policy framework focused on exchange rate stability serves Guyana’s needs best currently, and as the economy grows over the medium term, a revised monetary policy framework may be needed. The authorities noted that the accumulation of reserves and substantial buffers in the NRF will strengthen Guyana’s headroom to maintain a stable exchange rate. Exchange rate stability serves best Guyana’s current needs of a nominal anchor. The authorities consider that over the medium to long term, as Guyana become a major oil producer, a gradual shift towards greater exchange rate flexibility may allow the economy to better withstand shocks and maintain competitiveness. The authorities desire a step -by- step approach in deepening the interbank, domestic debt, and FX markets to strengthen the monetary policy framework and the transmission mechanism. The authorities emphasized that in the current framework, the reserves requirement rate can be used to curb credit supply, and this is a sufficient policy tool to tighten the monetary policy stance when needed.",Monetary Policy Adjustment,Monetary Policy,Monetary Policy,
"The BSP’s prompt action to fight inflation is welcome, but further monetary tightening may be needed to keep inflation expectations well anchored. Since May, the BSP has hiked the policy rate by a cumulative 225 basis points to 4.25 percent, and appropriately signaled that it is “prepared to take all necessary policy actions to bring inflation toward a target-consistent path over the medium term.” The current policy stance remains accommodative, with the real policy rate at about zero using staff’s projected inflation for 2023. Staff projects additional tightening over 2022 and 2023, to move the real policy interest rate to the lower end of staff’s estimated range for the real neutral rate of 1-2 percent. Bringing the policy rate to its neutral level will help to bring inflation within the target range and prevent a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Tighter monetary policy will also mitigate capital outflows and further exchange rate depreciation. Should inflation pressures continue to rise or prove more persistent, the BSP should respond with a tighter policy stance. Similarly, if inflation proves less persistent, or if significant downside risks to growth materialize, monetary policy tightening would need to be recalibrated.",Monetary Policy Adjustment,Monetary Policy,Monetary Policy,
"The authorities broadly agreed with the need for medium-term fiscal structural reforms and see challenges to the fiscal outlook in light of recent shocks. They concur on the need to focus medium-term fiscal policies on growth- and resilience-enhancing reforms. They are cautiously optimistic about the scope to mobilize revenues through tax policy reforms and expect larger yields from strengthening the revenue administration. Nonetheless, they agree that clear medium-term spending prioritization and tax policy planning are critical to accommodate development needs. The authorities agree on the importance of broad-based public reforms to improve the efficiency of government administration, the progressivity of the overall tax-transfer system, and the effectiveness of the social safety net. They are also keenly interested in reining in potential fiscal risks and strengthening the overall fiscal framework. While they concur that a gradual medium-term fiscal deficit reduction is needed to maintain a moderate debt level, the recent refugee inflow has created near-term fiscal pressures and poses medium-term challenges, the full fiscal impact of which is yet to be fully assessed and may hinder their ability to rebuild fiscal buffers quickly.",Fiscal Consolidation,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,
"The MTFF will anchor debt sustainability and restore fiscal space. It shows a firm commitment to a gradual fiscal consolidation path to reach the 3 percent deficit target in 2028 and bring the national government debt-to-GDP ratio to less than 60 percent over the medium term while highlighting the commitment to allocate at least 5 percent of GDP annually to infrastructure spending. The pace of fiscal consolidation outlined in the MTFF is appropriate, and the front-loaded fiscal consolidation starting in 2022–23 is expected to bring the national government debt down to below 59 percent of GDP in 2027 as recommended in the 2022 Article IV consultation. The authorities, with the help from Fund TA, are enhancing their macro-fiscal modeling capacity to better align fiscal and macroeconomic projections. As the MTFF has both debt and deficit as fiscal targets, the authorities could usefully identify that 60 percent of GDP debt ceiling as a fiscal anchor, while the fiscal deficit is an operational target to guide fiscal policy over the medium term.",Fiscal Consolidation,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,
"The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation and fiscal-structural reforms. They reiterated their commitment to achieve an average fiscal deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP over 2020-2022 and to continue fiscal consolidation in the medium term, with specific measures to be identified, including in the context of the upcoming medium-term strategy formulation. In case of negative shocks, fiscal policy would need to balance consolidation and growth objectives and would focus on high-multiplier spending. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s debt sustainability analysis and were open to considering the idea of interpreting the current debt limit more flexibly. They highlighted progress in structural reforms, including the institution of the high-level DMC, the publication for the first time of a debt sustainability analysis in budget documents, and the plans to establish a DMO within the Ministry of Finance. They also reiterated their commitment to push legislation to improve fiscal discipline and public procurement as well as plans to embed measures to improve public investment in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan currently under preparation.",Fiscal Consolidation,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,
"The authorities broadly agreed with Fund staff’s assessment of the near-term outlook and risks that staff presented during the mission. Like staff, they projected a rebound of economic activity in 2022, underpinned by fiscal support and pent-up demand, while their medium- term growth projection in the Economic Growth Achieved Case has projected higher growth than that of staff as they assumed higher TFP growth. On inflation, the authorities agreed that the recent increase mainly reflected rising commodity prices while the underlying price pressures remained weaker than in other advanced economies. They concurred with the preliminary assessment that Japan’s 2021 external position was broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. However, they underscored that the external balance assessment methodology is not well suited for a country with a large income surplus such as Japan.",Fiscal Policy Outlook,Economic Outlook,Economic Outlook,
"The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks. They saw growth at 6.5–7.5 percent in 2021, with inflation rebounding to about 2 percent. Growth would be primarily driven by robust external demand, and a rebound in investment as significant infrastructure projects resume. Ongoing stimulus measures would also continue to support the economy. The authorities agreed that risks to the medium-term outlook were tilted to the downside, with resurgences of COVID-19 cases representing the largest risk, but early vaccine availability posing an upside risk.",Fiscal Policy Outlook,Economic Outlook,Economic Outlook,
"The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks but were more optimistic on the prospects for near-term growth. They projected growth at 4.8 percent in 2020, primarily driven by robust private consumption underpinned by stable employment growth, a minimum wage increase in urban areas, and government assistance programs. They expected investment to pick up moderately as approved investments are realized and several large infrastructure projects are resumed. They expected inflation to rebound to about 2 percent in 2020, contingent on global oil prices and on the closing of the output gap. Over the medium term, the authorities saw growth at 4.5–5.5 percent, with risks stemming mainly from external sources and tilted to the downside.",Fiscal Policy Outlook,Economic Outlook,Economic Outlook,
"The recovery package provides an opportunity to expedite the adoption of climate- friendly policies and close green investment gaps. In its National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), Cyprus has set concrete objectives for 2030 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase the share of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in energy consumption, and improve energy efficiency (Text table). Policy priorities focus particularly in the areas of renewable energy, promoting natural gas, technological research, and major investment in energy and transport infrastructures. More investments are needed to improve electricity network to support renewable energy penetration and promote energy saving projects, including energy-efficient renovation of buildings. Given Cyprus’s high car ownership ratio and high dependence on road transportation, a feebate system could be considered and investment in green infrastructure and public transportation could also be scaled up to facilitate the use of green vehicles and increase the use of public transportation system.",Climate Policy Commitments,Climate Change,Climate Change,
"The authorities reiterated their strong commitment to continue pursuing structural reforms to ensure energy security and address climate change. Latvia has taken decisive steps to improve its energy security by replacing natural gas with renewable energy production, developing LNG import capacity, and strengthening integration into the European electricity grid. Substantial investments in wind and solar electricity generation are under way. Latvia recognizes the need for more ambitious climate policy for those GHG emissions not covered by the EU ETS. A draft climate change legislation aims to set sectoral targets and considers setting financial mechanism in case sectoral targets are not met and improve accountability for emissions. Latvia has also adopted a National Adaptation Plan, which will enhance adaptation policies in all government activities.",Climate Policy Commitments,Climate Change,Climate Change,
"The authorities reiterated their firm commitment to reaching a carbon emissions peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. They also emphasized their plan to establish new energy sources before closing old ones, to ensure energy security. The authorities noted that coal will continue to be an important energy source in China but based on “cleaner” technologies, in the long term mainly to meet for peak energy demand. They released the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 2035, the crucial first step towards increasing climate resilience. They also reported that the Emissions Trading Scheme was functioning well and will be strengthened going forward. They noted recent efforts to further enhance the climate finance ecosystem. Regulations are being prepared to implement the updated China Green Bond Principles, while new Green Finance Guidelines for the Banking and Insurance Sector were introduced to improve financial institutions’ climate-related financial risk management. Last year, the PBC conducted its first climate stress test, which assessed transition risks faced by major banks.

"The efforts to enhance the business environment need to be sustained. Brunei has made important progress in improving the business climate. For example, from 2016 to 2019, Brunei made strides in improving the World Bank Doing Business scores, with strong progress in access to credit and starting a business (Figure 6). More reforms, however, are needed to further improve the ease of doing business scores, in particular, in registering property and trading across borders. Making the regulatory framework more consultative, transparent and predictable would also help improve the business environment. A better business environment is paramount to support private sector-led growth and reduce unemployment, including youth unemployment.",Economic Diversification,Structural Reforms,Structural Reforms,
"Staff supported the authorities’ plans to deepen and diversify tourism and upgrade the value-chain of the fisheries sector under the Blue Economy initiatives (Box 5). Key goals include augmenting the domestic component of tourism-related activities through increased consumption of local agricultural products by the hotel industry and the promotion of local guest houses and other tourism services provided by local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Meeting these goals would help ensure that the benefits of economic growth are more widely distributed throughout the economy. Staff encouraged the authorities to accelerate efforts to activate the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA)21, which would help local tourism businesses to be better informed of potential demand. The authorities should also step up investment in vocational education to enhance productivity, help reduce labor market mismatch and increase local labor content in tourism and fisheries sectors. A high-level steering effort, complemented by the Blue Bond and The Third South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth (SWIOFish 3) projects, is key to the development of the fisheries sector.22 In line with the World Bank’s SWIOFish 3 The recent SWIOFish 3 consultant’s report highlights the importance of infrastructure improvement, skill development, and species diversification as key towards upgrading the fisheries industry. Strategic infrastructure development can facilitate the growth of an ecosystem connecting fishing vessels, exporters, and local businesses. This includes managing the ongoing development around Victoria port to establish it as a long-liner base and building new handling facilities. The report points out that Industrial Ultra-Low Temperature (ULT) freezing facilities are required to develop a stronger long-liner fishing fleet while the freezing facility at the airport should be revamped to increase its usage for ULT. The report also recommends strategic planning on talent and skill development. Currently, the fisheries industry relies mostly on foreign labor. Previous efforts to develop local labor content have seen limited results. Furthermore, the report encourages diversification and expansion of Seychelles’ species offering beyond yellowfin tuna given the recent quotas on yellowfin tuna: a comprehensive plan on aquaculture would help maximize fish production and exports while meeting conservation goals.",Economic Diversification,Structural Reforms,Structural Reforms,
"The authorities underscored the progress towards diversifying the economy and strengthening spillovers of FDI. The COVID-19 crisis provides an opportunity to foster change and step on diversification, digitalization, private sector development and climate change. In January 2021, the authorities launched the Economic Blueprint, which acts as a guide for stakeholders to build on the country’s economic success through well-defined aspirations and policy directions, complementing the efforts to achieve Wawasan Brunei 2035’s Goal 3 (Dynamic and Sustainable Economy). To ensure the success towards this goal, the Macroeconomic Development Committee was formed as a platform to discuss the development of the country’s macroeconomic outcomes as well as to produce a holistic direction. The authorities emphasized the importance of FDI and agreed on diversifying FDI projects to maximize their spin-off effects. Cross-border trade/investment have been encouraged by expanding FTAs (such as the RCEP signed in 2020). Efforts have been made to secure fair competition in the market. Continuing corporatization, PPP and privatization have also facilitated the private sector growth, with SOEs playing a strategic role to further stimulate market development. The authorities agreed on the need to expand high value-added employment, emphasizing education and training for expert competency. A variety of initiatives such as JobCentre Brunei, I-Ready and SkillsPlus has been proceeded on the close cooperation between ministries and industries. The authorities underlined the importance of improving productivity through investment on education and infrastructure, while looking for policies to improve sectors with weak productivity. They welcomed future engagements with the IMF to enhance its sectoral productivity especially in the five priority clusters. The authorities have accelerated digitalization by launching the Digital Economy Masterplan 2025 with sizable investment of about BND16 million. The restructuring of the communication industry has contributed to heightening efficiency and lowering consumer burdens with competition being preserved by opening market participation to private companies. The authorities have also implemented the BNCCP launched in 2020, including a pilot program to promote electric vehicles with a target of 60 percent of total car sales in 2035.",Economic Diversification,Structural Reforms,Structural Reforms,
"The authorities have demonstrated their strong determination to combat corruption and improve governance on several fronts. The country’s anti-corruption framework has been upgraded. An Anti-Corruption Law has been enacted, with the High Council on Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption mandated to supervise its implementation. In line with Afghanistan’s commitments to international and donor communities—with particular reference to the 2018 Geneva Conference––the High Council has adopted a comprehensive National Anti-corruption Strategy with a dedicated secretariat to monitor its implementation.

"Box 6. Corruption and AML/CFT Reforms Over the past several years, Mexico has embarked on an anti-corruption reform. Mexico was assessed against the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) anti-money laundering / combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in 2018. The current administration was elected on an anti-corruption platform.
The National Anti-Corruption System (NACS) is a constitutionally mandated anti-corruption reform. The NACS contains several measures, of which the most important are: i) appointment of an operationally independent anti-corruption prosecutor; ii) appointments of 18 judges to fill the new anti-corruption chamber at administrative courts; iii) implementation of new transparency requirements for public officials;
iv) drafting of a national anti-corruption policy; and v) creation of the National Digital Platform, to provide access to important data, such as procurement information. Except for the appointment of the judges, most other elements of the NACS are formally in place. However, the reform has yet to yield visible results and for the most part, enforcement, effective coordination and inter-agency peer pressure are still lacking.
A majority of the recommendations from a 2018 Fund staff-led AML/CFT assessment against the FATF standards have yet to be implemented. The FATF noted a range of shortcomings, notably related to the effectiveness of law enforcement and prosecution. Other major shortcomings were a lack of effectiveness of preventive measures in the financial sector, financial supervision and transparency of legal persons. Following the adoption of the assessment in October 2018, Mexico was placed in enhanced follow- up and given three years to enact legislation to address “most, if not all” legal shortcomings. Although the authorities have reported some progress so far, none of these measures were sufficient to warrant the necessary re-ratings. After this three-year period ends, FATF may consider additional enhanced follow-up measures (which include high level visits and public warnings). The authorities have prepared corresponding legislation which is, however, pending in Congress.
The Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) has increased the number of money laundering cases disseminated to the federal prosecutor (FGR). As noted by the new Attorney-General and the AML/CFT assessment, the FGR is facing fundamental shortcomings. These also prevent FGR from effectively following up on UIFs disseminations and from achieving levels of investigations, prosecutions, confiscations and convictions that would correspond to Mexico’s corruption and money laundering risks. A lack of expertise and the effects of corruption have a negative impact on the judiciary’s ability to effectively handle complex financial cases.",Anti-Corruption Efforts,Governance,Governance,
"In order to strengthen growth potential, it will be crucial for labor market policies to support the post-COVID economic adjustment (Annex IV). Cyprus’s labor market is relatively flexible but the ability to reallocate resources will depend crucially on the ability to address skills gap.17 Policies will need to transition from preserving jobs towards facilitating efficient labor reallocation. Specifically, active labor market policies, such as retraining and public employment services, should be further boosted given that spending on training and direct job creation in Cyprus has been among the lowest in the European Union. Education spending could be conducted more efficiently to enhance the quality of education and labor market outcomes. Updating relevant curricula and enhancing training to teachers would help close the mismatch between education and the labor market. The changing landscape of work opportunities will require greater investment in reskilling and upskilling to become more employable with digital skills or vocational skills for a green economy.",Labor Market Policies,Inclusion,Inclusion,

Staff welcomed the authorities’ revamped strategy to address labor market challenges, as detailed in the recently introduced National Employment Program 2.0. Staff recommended focusing on three areas to help address existing bottlenecks in Bahrain’s labor market, including containing public wages and benefits to improve the attractiveness of private sector jobs, continuing to address skills mismatches in the labor market with well-integrated professional training programs in cooperation with all stakeholders, and facilitating labor market mobility across jobs (Selected Issues Paper III).

"Reducing labor skill-mismatches, increasing human capital and technology access would also boost labor productivity. A sizable fraction of Vietnam’s labor force reports a skill mismatch in their jobs, reflecting existing frictions in the labor market, and gaps in educational and vocational training. Labor market duality has also hindered human capital accumulation, as informal workers receive inadequate training, which impedes reallocation of workers toward productive jobs.15 The new Labor Code, which now covers workers previously employed informally by registered firms, will also help reduce labor market frictions and lower informality.16 Closing information gaps, reducing market fragmentation, and strengthening labor-market governance (e.g., increased coordination and data sharing between agencies) would help reduce skill mismatches. Efforts to strengthen the link between education, training, and skill demand, and improving access to digital infrastructure will also allow workers to reap the benefits of the structural and digital transformation wrought by the pandemic (see Annex III and IV).",Labor Market Policies,Inclusion,Inclusion,
"The low government revenue reflects a narrow tax base, inefficient collection, weak compliance, and the complexity of the tax system. The basic structure of the tax system and the headline rates of the most important taxes (corporate income tax, personal income tax, value added tax) are broadly in line with ASEAN peers. But weaknesses in the tax policy framework generate weaker revenue performance and create inefficiencies, leading to suboptimal outcomes, inequities, and complexities in administration and compliance. For example, the myriad of sector-based special regimes in the corporate income tax (CIT) system along with multiple discretionary incentives prevent a level playing field across sectors and firms, distorting factor allocation across sectors. High basic exemption threshold for the personal income tax (PIT) excludes a large share of the population, notably the growing middle class, from sharing the tax burden. A very long number of value-added tax (VAT)-exempt activities combined with an exceptionally high registration threshold partially explains the low VAT revenue, which have been declining as a percent of GDP since 2014.",Tax Reform,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,
"There is ample scope to enhance revenue mobilization, which can underpin a faster medium-term fiscal consolidation, while securing resources for the authorities’ social and development plans. The national government tax-to-GDP ratio, at 14 percent of GDP, is relatively low. Based on staff’s assessment, there is significant scope to raise additional tax revenues—of at least 1.4 percent of GDP above the baseline under VAT, corporate and personal income taxes. This will be more than enough to achieve a faster consolidation, with the remainder of about 0.7 percent of GDP used to finance high-priority spending and increase support for the vulnerable. In the near-term, the Philippines can pursue high-quality tax reforms to boost revenue collection and improve tax composition by (i) broadening the PIT base and improving capital income taxation; (ii) streamlining investment tax incentives and strengthening cross-border taxation; (iii) expanding the VAT base; and (iv) enhancing excise taxation (by removing tax exemptions and tapping new bases). The tax reform should focus on improving the overall efficiency and equity of the tax regime while excluding policies that are difficult to implement and administer, or that have a negligible revenue impact. These reforms should be complemented with ongoing efforts to improve revenue administration, including through enhanced use of e-filing and electronic payments, and sustained efforts by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and Bureau of Customs (BOC) to improve tax compliance by stepping up efforts for digital tax filing.",Tax Reform,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,
"The MTFF could be further complemented. The national government tax-to-GDP ratio, at 14.6 percent of GDP in 2022, is relatively low (Figure 6). Notably, the collection of VAT is particularly weak, capturing only a third of its potential tax base. The authorities could introduce a tax-policy oriented medium-term revenue strategy which lays out more ambitious tax measures to protect and finance more social spending and recover from natural disasters while keeping the consolidation path unchanged. Timely implementation of tax policy measures identified in the FY2024 budget is critical. Additional measures could be considered to enhance revenue generation, including broadening the VAT and corporate income tax (CIT) bases by rationalizing exemptions, and evaluating the implementation of the 2021 Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act (CREATE) and incentivizing investment through expensing of capital spending. The rationalization of the mining fiscal regime provides an opportunity to simplify the royalty and tax structure by introducing progressivity and reducing incentives for aggressive tax planning while establishing a competitive investment climate. These reforms are being complemented by ongoing efforts to improve tax administration, including through digital tax filing and electronic payments, and sustained efforts to enhance tax compliance. Examples of such efforts include the Bureau of Internal Revenue’s Digitalization Program, and the Bureau of Customs’ Computer-Aided Risk Management System.

Further efforts to optimize the debt portfolio by substituting external for domestic financing should strike the right balance between improving debt terms (lowering interest payments and extending maturities) and maintaining a safe exposure to external risks. In particular, the debt composition target (currently 50-50) should be revised to take into account the current macro-fiscal framework, existing vulnerabilities in the debt portfolio, market capacity constraints, and the expected evolution of market variables (interest and exchange rates).

"On balance, staff assesses Niger’s external position as weaker than suggested by fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The less favorable results of the EBA-lite current account model need to be qualified by this approach not accounting for capital transfers, which are important in Niger’s case, and balanced against the moderate overvaluation identified in the exchange rate model. Perhaps most importantly, there are good reasons for Niger’s large current account deficits for the time being, considering its enormous development needs as the world’s most underdeveloped country and record high population growth. Both require investment well beyond domestic financing capacities. In this sense, foreign direct investment and donor support are welcome and, by extension, the implied external deficit. That said, the flags raised by the models and the sheer size of the current account deficit warrant close monitoring of Niger’s external position. It will be paramount to put the external resources to good use, ensure high-quality investment, seek out external grants rather than loans, and, most importantly, develop Niger’s still embryonic domestic private sector so that it can better substitute for imports and export more going forward.",External Position Analysis,External Stance,External Stance,
"The Fund’s EBA-lite current account model assesses Niger’s current account as substantially weaker than fundamentals would suggest. Concretely, Niger’s current account deficit is 9.5 percent of GDP larger than the norm calculated from the model’s key fundamental variables. Deviations of economic policies from their medium-term desired levels play a negligible role in explaining this gap – the deficit-enhancing effects of a relatively large fiscal deficit and relatively stringent capital controls are largely neutralized by the deficit reducing-effects of insufficient accumulation of external reserves and relatively low private-sector credit growth. Closing the gap by exchange rate adjustment alone would require a large depreciation of 17 percent, assuming an export elasticity of 0.47 and an import elasticity of 1.32 as calibrated for Niger by Tokarick (IMF WP/10/180). However, these results need to be interpreted with caution considering that the EBA-lite model does not take all factors pertinent to the case of Niger into account. For example, it disregards large capital grants of 5.9 percent of GDP in 2018. If these were considered a fundamental instead and deducted from the current account deficit, overvaluation would decline to 6 percent.",External Position Analysis,External Stance,External Stance,
"Based on preliminary data and EBA model results, the external position in 2020 was stronger than the level implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. In 2020, the REER and NEER depreciated by 8.5 and 8.3 percent, respectively. The EBA-based current account gap of 2.3 percent of GDP (compared to a gap of 1 percent in 2019) suggests that the external position in 2020 was stronger than the level implied by fundamentals and desirable policies, although the assessment is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment is driven by the larger deterioration in fundamentals of the EBA-model global comparator group of countries than in Costa Rica, as the sharp import compression and resilience of free trade zone exports contained the weakening of the country’s external position (see Annex IV). As the health and economic crisis recedes domestically and globally, fiscal consolidation should resume, consistently with the fiscal rule, to prevent a deterioration in external sustainability. The authorities recognized that the assessment was driven by the relative performance of Costa Rica compared to the EBA comparator country group and is subject to a high level of uncertainty, given the major shock to the global economy in 2020. In particular, they noted that the adjustments for multilateral consistency masked the weakening of the country’s external position in 2020, as indicated by the larger current account deficit, despite a sharp import compression and depreciation of the currency.",External Position Analysis,External Stance,External Stance,
"The authorities and staff agreed that social assistance needs to be strengthened. According to World Bank estimates, poverty increased by 11 percentage points to 31 percent in 2020 as incomes declined. Unemployment rose and may increase further this year. Compared to other low-income countries, social spending in the Kyrgyz Republic is relatively high (3.6 percent of GDP), but does not translate into better social and poverty outcomes due to weak targeting, low coverage, and limited adequacy. Household survey data suggest that the coverage of the lowest income quintile is only 17.4 percent, 34 percentage points below the regional median. Adequacy is also low for the bottom quintile at 11.4 percent, compared to the regional average of 21.6 percent, and the bottom three income deciles receive 20.5 percent of the total, compared to 45.2 percent allocated to the top three deciles. In addition, the overlaps between various social programs result in resource misallocation and administrative burdens. These shortcomings can be addressed by broadening the coverage of social assistance, shifting from categorical to income-based targeting, and consolidating social assistance programs to eliminate duplication.",Social Assistance,Inclusion,Inclusion,
"The social safety net should be strengthened. According to the World Bank, Brazil has many social protection and labor programs, but they are insufficiently coordinated, creating duplication and regressive spending10 although at 1.5 percent of GDP, Brazil’s overall spending on social assistance programs is in line with peer countries. Among the social assistance programs, BF is well targeted and cost effective, but 70 percent of BPC benefits accrue to the richest 60 percent of the population.11 In addition, labor market programs that provide wage subsidies such as Abono Salarial and Salário Família have an almost complete overlap of recipients (“double dipping”), mostly of richer households. Staff supports the World Bank recommendation to consolidate all current non-contributory cash benefit programs into one single program. The rationalization could save roughly 0.7 percent of GDP under the expenditure ceiling that could be used to fund an expanded BF or a new social assistance program that is modeled after BF and best practices from OECD countries.",Social Assistance,Inclusion,Inclusion,
"Ongoing efforts to strengthen coverage and targeting of social assistance programs can provide critical support to the most vulnerable during and beyond the pandemic. While current spending levels on social assistance programs are broadly in line with countries at a similar development level, the authorities’ planned structural increase in selected social assistance spending by 0.1 percent of GDP (about 5 percent of existing programs) starting in 2021, is expected to help expand coverage for the poorest income deciles and, according to model estimates by the WB, reduce income inequality by 0.4 Gini percentage points, lifting more than 12 thousands people out of poverty (Annex VI). This will be complemented by further enhancements to the social transfers’ delivery system, through digitalization and centralization at the MOF’s National Treasury, with support from IMF TA, to allow for more efficient channeling of resources.

Regarding electricity, they stressed that prices are already higher than in neighboring countries, and that further increases could put firms at a competitive disadvantage. They also emphasized that reform in that area would require careful planning and a gradual approach. To contain fiscal risks, the authorities agreed to limit energy subsidies to a maximum of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2022. This would be achieved through a reactivation of the decree regarding fuel prices, an audit of the methodology to determine the compensation of the national power utility, and a revision of the decree on electricity prices, while protecting vulnerable households (proposed new SB, June 2022). In addition, the government will publish a roadmap for the gradual elimination of energy subsidies starting in 2023, including a communication phase and support measures for vulnerable households (proposed new SB, June 2022) (MEFP ¶30).",Energy Subsidies,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,
"Staff highlighted the urgent need to contain energy subsidies. Rising world oil prices pose a significant risk to the budget and could crowd out other spending priorities. The 2022 budget would allow to cover energy subsidies for a maximum of 0.9 percent of GDP which, according to staff estimates, would likely be only sufficient if the average price per barrel (Brent) remains at or below US$75 per barrel. Staff estimates that subsidy needs could reach close to 2 percent of GDP at an average oil price of US$85 per barrel in 2022. Staff therefore urged the authorities to cap energy subsidies at the budgeted amount by moving towards greater price flexibility while protecting the vulnerable. Staff also stressed the broadly inefficient and regressive nature of energy subsidies and noted that the authorities’ strategy to reduce energy subsidies should be anchored in the preparation of a public roadmap. Such a roadmap would include steps towards automatically-adjusting retail prices for fuel and electricity while protecting poor households and selected priority consumers through targeted measures. While reforms in the electricity sector and the gradual switch from oil to domestically-produced gas for power generation will eventually lower electricity subsidies, staff pointed out that the gas-to-power strategy requires significant planning and investment and is affected by the uncertain outlook for gas prices (see Selected Issues Paper; MEFP, ¶30).",Energy Subsidies,Fiscal Stance,Fiscal Stance,

Real house prices in Luxembourg continued to increase rapidly, exacerbating already acute affordability issues, and are estimated to be overvalued (about 18 percent in Q2 2020). The disproportionate impact of the pandemic on vulnerable groups, in conjunction with rising house prices, make the issue of the availability of affordable housing even more pressing. In 2020, the government rightly took steps to improve the supply of affordable housing available for sale. For example, the Pacte Logement 2.0 will link the provision of financial support to municipalities to the number of affordable housing units built, and raise the requirement for minimum built surface dedicated to affordable housing from 10 to 30 percent. In addition, the 2021 budget includes measures intended to discourage speculation in the real estate market and support rental supply (such as by lowering the depreciation rate for rented properties).

"Oil revenue helped improve the overall fiscal position while debt servicing costs remain high (Figure 4). The provisional federal government (FG) deficit remained flat at 4 percent of GDP in 2018, as higher oil and gas revenue helped offset a 35 percent year-on-year increase in capital expenditures. Non-oil revenue collection was lower than budgeted for all items and did not improve further—despite continuing improvements in tax administration—as planned increases in excises (alcohol, tobacco) have not been fully implemented and the tax base continues to narrow (e.g., new VAT exemption for airlines). Low revenues and relatively high domestic yields have kept interest payments-to-FG revenue ratio high at 60 percent in 2018 (Annex IV). Meanwhile, state and local governments’ incomes benefited from higher oil revenues and Paris Club refunds from the FG, reducing their estimated combined deficit. Amidst a generally comparatively small government size, priority expenditure, such as on health and education, remains among the lowest worldwide. with lower recurrent spending offset by higher capital spending. The impact of the proposed minimum wage—an increase from N18,000 to N30,000—if passed on moderately to other salary grades as currently planned—would be contained and is largely accounted for in the budget. Absent major revenue reforms, and accounting for non-budgeted expenditures such as electricity subsidies, the overall FG deficit-to-GDP ratio would expand to 4.7 percent in 2019 and hover around just below 4 percent in the medium term. This would increase the consolidated government debt-to- GDP ratio to almost 36 percent by 2024 and the interest payments-to-FG revenue ratio to 74.6 percent.

"Long-term sustainability of the pension system (Box 4). Thanks to dynamic population growth, Luxembourg’s pension system remains in surplus and has accumulated appreciable reserves in recent years. However, given less favorable migration flows and population ageing in the future, the European Commission’s 2018 Ageing Report projects pension expenditures to increase from 9 to 15 percent of GDP within one generation (by 2058). This would increase the fiscal deficit and the debt by 9 and 76 percent of GDP, respectively. Luxembourg has currently the lowest effective retirement age in the EU (60 vs. 63 years) and the second largest replacement rate (73 vs. 46 percent). Given the long lags of pension reforms, the authorities should engage key stakeholders in a timely way to agree on a pension reform over the medium term to ensure a gradual adjustment and more intergenerational equity. Reform options include increasing contributions, reducing replacement rates, and increasing the retirement age. Staff simulations show that, while all reform options can ensure the pension system’s long-term sustainability, they have important macroeconomic tradeoffs. Higher retirement age increases GDP per capita and consumption relative to the baseline, while lower replacement rates and higher contributions reduce disposable income and consequently consumption per capita. Moreover, higher contribution rates introduce labor market distortions, reducing GDP per capita.",Pension System Sustainability,Inclusion,Fiscal Stance,
"Pension reform is needed to strengthen the system given Korea’s rapid demographic shifts. Pension reforms are required given the coming rise in the ratio of retirees-to-workers. Currently, contribution rates are not commensurate with benefits, and the relatively low level of pension benefits is a driver of Korea’s relatively high old-age poverty rate. Taking early steps to address these long-term challenges would ease the transition relative to making a sharper adjustment later. Priority should be given to ensuring that the pension system is on an actuarially sound footing. Increases in pension coverage and generosity should be balanced with appropriate adjustments in contribution rates and the retirement age commensurate with longer life expectancy. In addition, in line with the 2020 FSAP recommendation, reforms could also include the development of pension and contractual savings products by introducing multi-employer pension schemes and building further capacity for oversight of pension funds market. Strengthening pension benefits would also reduce over time the need to over relay on real estate assets to self-insurance for retirement.",Pension System Sustainability,Inclusion,Inclusion,
"Increasing contribution rates remains critical to ensure adequate self-financed pensions and reduce fiscal costs. Chile’s full-capitalization pension system has low replacement rates due to a combination of low contribution rates and density, declining returns, and rising life expectancy. The situation aggravated with the pension withdrawals over 2020–21. The government’s proposed hike in the contribution rate by 6 percentage points would be essential for lifting replacement rates of the contributory system, but political disagreement on what share to be assigned to the solidarity pension has stalled a pension reform for over a decade. To address old-age poverty risks, the coverage and amount of solidarity pensions were increased with the introduction of the minimum pension (PGU) in 2022, which lifted the average 19 percent gross pension replacement rate of the capitalization system to above 60 percent (compared to an OECD average of about 50 percent) and largely closed the pension gender gap (text chart). However, since the PGU represents a sizable net fiscal cost and costs with solidarity pensions could double to 4 percent of GDP between 2023 and 2050 due to population aging, sustainable increases in financing and/or adjustments to the PGU going forward are needed (Annex VII).",Pension System Sustainability,Inclusion,Inclusion,
"A comprehensive civil service reform would reduce fiscal costs and improve incentives for private employment (Annex IV). Absence of a centralized database of civil servants and poor monitoring are key impediments to effective wage bill management. Thus, the most urgent priority is to put in place an effective IT system that enables strong monitoring, control, and accountability mechanisms within a centralized HR framework across all levels of government. A comprehensive functional review of the civil service must eliminate “ghost workers” and inform optimization of tasks, staffing, and business processes across government institutions. The remuneration framework will need to align pay scales, optimize non-wage payments within an overall cap, and link compensation to productivity under a robust performance assessment framework. A thorough revision of the broader legal framework will need to eliminate hiring and compensation commitments outside of the common HR framework. The authorities were supportive of these views. They pointed out that strengthening the mandate and capacity of the recently established— although not yet fully operational—Federal Civil Service Commission is a key pre-requisite to initiate a civil service reform.

"Emergency support mitigated crisis-related liquidity challenges for corporates and households, but corporate solvency risks have increased. The STWS and loan-guarantee support helped absorb household and firm income losses and prevented a disruption of credit. While corporates built up substantial liquidity buffers, their debt-to-income ratio surged by almost 15 percentage points in 2020, presenting potential solvency challenges going ahead. Staff analysis suggests that after policy support, Austria has an equity gap of around 1 percent of GDP compared to pre-crisis levels.8 While temporary liquidity support to crisis-affected companies should continue, policies should gradually shift toward solvency support for viable firms—including private sector participation to leverage private expertise in the selection and monitoring of beneficiaries—while allowing nonviable firms to exit.9 Enhancing debt restructuring mechanisms, including by providing tools and incentives for voluntary debt resolution, pre- emptively increasing court capacity and swiftly implementing the 2019 EU Restructuring Directive can also help contribute to efficient capital reallocation.",Corporate Solvency,Financial Stability,Financial Stability,
"The exit strategy from the support measures will require a careful balancing act. Although bankruptcies in 2020 have so far remained stable compared to 2019, they could start rising as the moratoria expire, posing a significant risk to financial stability. To avoid this cliff-edge effect, existing schemes should be phased out gradually as the recovery proceeds, and eligibility criteria should be tightened to better target, on a temporary basis, viable or potentially viable companies, operating in hard-hit sectors (e.g., tourism and hospitality). As the recovery strengthens, prudential standards should be normalized—and clearly communicated—so that problem assets can be dealt with in a timely manner. The insolvency regime should be strengthened to facilitate the swift repair of bank balance sheets and prevent the rise of “zombie” firms. If NPLs risk rising to a systemic level, a holistic unwinding strategy to flatten the insolvency curve is warranted and should be informed by a triage of companies (into viable, viable with restructuring, and unviable) to identify the policy trade-offs, given fiscal and financial stability constraints.4 The authorities should expedite the ongoing reform process and complete the transposition of the EU Directive on Preventive Restructuring Frameworks.",Corporate Solvency,Financial Stability,Financial Stability,
"Enhancing debt restructuring mechanisms can complement the efficacy of solvency support initiatives. France registers the highest rate of annual insolvencies worldwide, accounting for almost one third of total insolvencies in western Europe. An increase in insolvencies from the pandemic of about 50 percent (text figure) could overwhelm court capacity, risking indiscriminate firm liquidation. Temporarily increasing the administrative capacity of France’s out-of-court restructuring mechanisms (mandat ad hoc and conciliation) in the near term could prevent this and enable viable firms to restore their financial health. It may also be useful to adopt corporate triaging, distinguishing between businesses that can and cannot be restructured based on transparent criteria and led by private-sector specialists, allowing the expeditious winding down of non-viable firms. This would facilitate capital reallocation towards viable firms and contribute to avoiding long-run scarring from debt overhang.
