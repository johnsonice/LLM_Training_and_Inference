        Matthew Gray at Carbon Tracker, a think-tank, said the price of carbon credits was being supported by the gradual reopening of economies and expectations that industrial activity, and emissions, will rebound in the coming months. '[Carbon] has been the number one performer in the European energy complex for some time now and is being bolstered by hopes of trade relief and an easing of lockdown restrictions,' Mr Gray said.
