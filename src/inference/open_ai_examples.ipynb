      "Paragraph: Additional, targeted fiscal support is warranted in 2022-2023. The 2022 Budget allocated RM23 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) out of the COVID Fund for COVID-related spending, with an increasing share spent on upskilling programs, social assistance support to vulnerable groups, and SME financing. Considering the still-sizable projected economic slack, medium-term pandemic scarring effects, generally favorable debt dynamics, and staff’s assessment that debt is sustainable (Appendix II), staff advice is to provide modest additional fiscal support by about 2 percentage points cumulatively in 2022 and 2023 above the 2022 budget plans, moving the fiscal impulse in 2022 from negative to moderately positive territory, and delaying the start of consolidation by one year to 2023.8 The additional stimulus would close the output gap faster than in the baseline, thus helping limit the pandemic’s scarring effects. Targeted additional spending should center on protecting the vulnerable (notably low-income highly-indebted households), supporting viable SMEs in hard-hit sectors, and minimizing the impact of scarring on inequality, and increasing productive capacity—through public investments in green and climate-resilient projects, improved training and education, strengthened health policies, and digital transformation. However, the higher public debt with pre-COVID-19 fiscal vulnerabilities, warrants a cautious approach towards continued fiscal support, as a protracted pandemic could entail future spending pressures. In that respect, federal government debt remains below the effective debt limit (of 67 percent of GDP) implied by the twice- raised 65 percent of GDP limit on domestic debt under both baseline and staff recommended fiscal paths. Furthermore, staff recommendation involves a larger consolidation (by about 3 percentage points) in the medium term compared to the passive baseline, that would put debt on a firm downward trend and help rebuild fiscal buffers necessary to respond to future shocks.\n",

It emphasizes the importance of fiscal sustainability, public finances, and the management of government expenditure.

      "Paragraph: The authorities agreed that additional fiscal support focused on supply-side measures is warranted in 2022. They also backed the idea of a medium-term expenditure-based consolidation plan, to be implemented only once the recovery is on firm ground. They concurred that the near-term priority for fiscal policy is to support the recovery and minimize scarring by boosting workers skills and investment, and shared the view that the improvement in the fiscal deficit envisaged in the 2022 budget would not constitute a tightening of the fiscal stance but rather an appropriate scaling down of emergency support programs. While the authorities agreed that some of the measures in response to rising energy prices are widely distributed, they preferred a broader and swift approach to provide timely support to all the households significantly impacted by the surge in energy prices. They stressed that these measures would be temporary. The authorities underscored that a priority beyond 2022 is to redress France’s public finances and rebuild fiscal buffers while making space for critical investment to support the green and digital transformation, and to facilitate reallocation of resources. They highlighted that the “France 2030” plan goes in this direction and agreed with staff that ensuring good governance of the program, with strong private-sector involvement, would be key. They aim at stabilizing public debt and get it on a declining path by 2026, as recommended by staff, by boosting potential growth factors and containing government expenditure, prioritizing growth-friendly expenditure. The authorities remain convinced that a reform of the pension system should play a key role. They also concurred with other priority areas for savings outlined by staff but consider that structural spending reforms will need to be implemented after a new government takes office. The authorities reiterated their commitment toward safeguarding public funds.\n",
